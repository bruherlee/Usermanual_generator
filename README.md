📝 Automated User Manual

Hi there! 👋 I’m Pavithra, and this project is an Automated User Manual Generator that simplifies documenting web applications and workflows.

🌟 Overview

Creating user manuals manually can be time-consuming and error-prone, especially for complex web applications or frequently updated tools. This project solves that problem by automatically generating step-by-step user manuals with minimal effort.

The system captures screenshots, extracts text content, and organizes every interaction into a structured, easy-to-read guide. The final output is a ready-to-share PDF manual, saving hours of manual documentation work.

Whether you’re building internal tools, SaaS products, or participating in hackathons, this tool makes documentation fast, accurate, and professional.
